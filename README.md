# Aocf-netplay-shortcut-creator
If you don't play Touhou 15.5, also known as AoCF or 東方憑依華, you clicked the wrong link. Stay only if you are going to play the game.

To create the shortcuts, just run netplay-picker.bat on Windows. This was tested on Windows 10.

After creating each shortcut, you can rename and move the .bat files to anywhere you want, but if you move or rename the .dlls, they shortcuts won't work anymore. If the shortcuts don't work, just run netplay-picker.bat again and input the correct paths.

Download the DLLs from:

THCRAP is necessary for the shortcuts to work:
